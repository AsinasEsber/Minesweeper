## README for Minesweeper Project

### Minesweeper Game

This repository contains a fully-functional Minesweeper game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates advanced web development techniques, including dynamic layout generation, asynchronous API requests, and responsive design. 

#### Features

- **Dynamic Layout**: The game board is dynamically generated based on the selected difficulty level.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: The game communicates with a remote server to manage game state, using asynchronous API calls.
- **Touch and Mouse Events**: The game supports both mouse and touch interactions, making it compatible with both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Customizable Difficulty**: Players can choose from three difficulty levels - Small, Medium, and Large.

#### Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For the styling and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For game logic, dynamic UI updates, and asynchronous API communication.

#### Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

##### Prerequisites

- Web browser (latest version recommended)

##### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/asinas99/minesweeper.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd minesweeper
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to start the game.

#### Usage

- **Start the Game**: Open the game in your web browser.
- **Select Difficulty**: Choose from Small, Medium, or Large difficulty by clicking the respective button.
- **Gameplay**: Click on the cells to reveal them. Right-click (or long press on touch devices) to flag a cell as a mine.

#### Code Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the structure of the web page.
- `styles.css`: Contains the CSS rules for styling the game.
- `script.js`: Includes the JavaScript code for game logic and interaction handling.

#### Highlights

- **Dynamic Cell Generation**: The game board cells are created dynamically based on the selected difficulty level, ensuring a scalable and flexible layout.
- **Event Handling**: Efficient handling of both mouse and touch events to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Interaction with a remote server to fetch game state and update the board in real-time.
